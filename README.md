- 👋 Hi, I’m Gregor @gr33gYss
- 👀 I’m interested in web and game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS for front web development and C# with Unity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that doesn't require too much skill as I am new to the world of programming (but I'm not afraid to take on a challenge).
- 📫 How to reach me?
